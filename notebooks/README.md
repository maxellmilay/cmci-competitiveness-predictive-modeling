## 1 - Alternative Weighting Methods Using PCA and Factor Analysis

Cambel and Albacea (2021) proposed a statistically driven approach using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and factor analysis to assign data-driven weights to competitiveness indicators.

## 2 - Spatial Autocorrelation for Pattern Detection

Encarnacion et al. (2023) applied Moran's I to detect clustering of competitiveness scores across LGUs, where they discovered "high-high" and "low-low" clusters.

## 3 - Feature Selection with PROMETHEE-GAIA and Spectral Clustering

Abellana (2025) implemented an unsupervised feature selection methodology combining PROMETHEE-GAIA and spectral clustering, allowing a visual and algorithmic reduction of CMCI dimensions.

## 4 - Predictive Modeling for Real Estate

Ramolete et al. (2023) used tree-based ML models to predict property values using CMCI indicators, showing high accuracy and highlighting the relevance of competitiveness data for private-sector investment and real estate planning

## 5 - National Economic Forecasting as Blueprint

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) developed inflation forecasting models using support vector regression (SVR), ANNs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
